## Requirements

- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via **Make a Block**), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

## Concept
Anchoring game, you are the captain of a small boat and have the task of anchoring yourself in a specific spot

The issue you have is that 
1. The current will move your anchor at a random speed
2.  You must drop your anchor a the right spot in relation to where your boat's line will run out
3. The sea bed is not at a constant level, so it may change from level to level

The score you receive will be how close you are to the target
